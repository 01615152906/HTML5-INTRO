<section>There are 600 million active blogs on the Internet, (the blogosphere) accounting for one-third of all the websites published. Starting off as online personal diaries, blogs have evolved dramatically over the last two decades to become influential sources of information on virtually any topic.</section>

     <h5>trip planning</h5>
     <p>Whichever your motivation, there’s one golden rule to follow: choose a topic you are deeply passionate about. After all, passion is infectious. The more engaged you are with your subject, the easier it will convey your ideas, opinions, and emotions—and engage your readers with you.</p>
     <p>You can create a blog to inspire, to educate, or to connect with others. But blogging is not just for your readers. It’s also for yourself. There’s a lot of gratification that comes with expressing yourself in new, digital forms by learning how to make a website. Finally, when you start growing your readership, blogging can become a sustainable stream of revenue. There are plenty of creative ways to monetize your blog as it grows, from affiliate links to banner advertising, to self-publishing and sponsored posts.</p>

     <p>To help you get started, we’ve narrowed down the list of the top 20 most popular types of blogs, plus real Wix user examples and website types. Whether it’s food or fashion, we hope you’ll find a topic you’re excited about and feel a calling to contribute to.</p>
     <p>Food blogs come in several flavors. On the one hand, there are the food critics, who go from one restaurant table to the next, tasting different dishes and narrating their experiences. On the other hand, there’s the cooking and baking enthusiasts. They document their recipes—from the ingredients they use to the steps they follow—and share them with their communities through articles, photos and videos.</p>
